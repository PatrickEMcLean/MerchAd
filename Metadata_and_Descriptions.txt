Metadata and Descriptions


An ordinary, money-grubbing Merchant struggling to make a coin off penniless, incompetent adventurers is forced to take on the impossible quest of saving his town and rescuing the woman he loves from a treacherous and powerful Wizard. The result is a battle of wit, wits and haggling that is part homage to (and part skewer of) the richly worked and often overwrought fantasy genre.

An artful, satire of dungeon crawls and cRPGs, the Merchant Adventurer is part Princess Bride, part Dungeon Pawn Stars and a rollicking good read.
